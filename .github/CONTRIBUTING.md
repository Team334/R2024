## Contributing to discord.py

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of rules for contributing to this repository.

## Good Bug Reports

Please be aware of the following things when making bug reports.

1. Don't open duplicate issues. Please search your issue to see if it has been asked already. Duplicate issues will be closed and ignored.
2. When filing a bug about exceptions or tracebacks, please include the *complete* traceback. Without the complete traceback the issue might be **unsolvable** and you will be asked to provide more information.
3. Make sure to provide enough information to make the issue solvable. The issue template will guide through the process.
    - A **summary** of your bug report. This is generally a quick sentence or two to describe the issue in simple terms.
    - Guidance on **how to reproduce the issue**. You can provide or steps to reproduce this issue.
    - Tell us **what you expected to happen**. That way we can meet that expectation.
    - Tell us **what actually happens**. What ends up happening insteading of what you expected
    - Tell us **information about your system information**. What version of java, wpilib, etc do you use?

If the bug report is missing this information then it'll take us longer to fix the issue. We will probably ask for clarification.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Submitting a pull request is fairly simple, just make sure it focuses on a single aspect.


If you do not meet any of these guidelines, please double check what you have missed and add those requirements
